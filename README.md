#TIY-Final-Project

##Description

As a large portion of our population cotinues to age, the demand for healthcare professionals is increasing.  In the absence of full time employee availability (due to last minute absences, planned time off, spikes in treatment demand, etc.), healthcare management companies often rely on contract or "PRN" (from Latin, Pro Re Nata or "as needed") employees to ensure patients are treated per their individual treatment plan schedule.  The process for securing PRN resources is often time consuming and cumbersome, as staffing managers allocate significant time coommunicating (usually via phone, email or text) with PRN employees to assess availability and willingness to fill coverage gaps.  Consequently, patient treatment is often delayed, resulting in a negative experience for the patient (i.e., a delay in necessary treatment) and the organization responsible for facilitating that treatment (operational ineffieciency, delayed billing opportunities.)     

We're taking a new approach to managing PRN staffing.  PRN Match will provide healthcare management companies (specifically, longterm care management organizations) with a web based repository of credentialed and company registered healthcare professionals searchable by location, credential type, availability and user rating.  Making this information easily and immediately availlable will reduce the inefficiencies associated with sourcing PRN employees in both planned and unplanned gap situations and allow patients to be treated per their defined treatment plan schedule.  

*TEMPORARY:  Developing and web application to allow contract rehabilitation healthcare professionals to post their credentials, availability, location and other criteria that will be searchable by rehab organizations in search of their skill set.*
