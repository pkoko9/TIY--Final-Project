    			<div class = "home-text">The process of securing credentialed PRN resources to fill unexpected healthcare organization needs is time consuming and inefficient.  When a staffing need arises, a hiring company wastes considerable time and resources making numerous contacts via phone and text to determine the work availability and willingness of its registered PRN. As demand for healthcare services increases, today's PRN staffing inefficiencies will only continue to increase.  PRN Staffing Solutions exists to minimize those ineffciencies and delivers a simple, user friendly interface that reduces PRN hiring delays.  We connect PRNs to their ideal employment opportunities, and help hiring organizations quickly fill their staffing needs to ensure there are no delays in a patient's treatment schedule.<br><br>

          Our interface is easy to use for both PRNs and healthcare management organizatons:<br><br>

          <h3>For PRNs:</h3>
          
          <ol>
            <li>Create a profile that includes contact detail, current availability, area of specialty and companies registered with.</li>

            <li>Maintain your profile. (This is very important if you want access to the most opportunities!)</li>

            <li>Pick your ideal work opportunities as they present themselves!</li><br>
          </ol>

          <h3>For hiring organizations:</h3>

          <ol>
            <li>Create a profile that incudes pertinent contact information.</li>

            <li>Simply search for available PRNs registered with your organization with the credentials needed and click their phone number to communicate your need.  No more calling/texting to determine availability to work.</li><br>
          </ol> 

          Thanks for giving our app a try.  We are confident that it will be a valuable tool to quickly connect PRN employees with the agencies requiring their expertise.
